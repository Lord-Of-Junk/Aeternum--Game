Aeternum--Game
==============

"Good Morning valued employee number *fzzzzzt* It is day *bzzzzzzt* of your *kzzzzzzt* day work excursion! As always we expect peak efficiency from our workers. Remember unproductive workers are unfulfilled workers!" The intercom fizzled out, as it always did after morning announcements. Ugh. Another day, more work. Digging more, building more, I better get started...
