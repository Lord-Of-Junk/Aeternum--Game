Aeternum--Game
==============

This is a game set 80 years in the future. Industry has grown and prosper as technological growth
has stagnated. In fact, it has even declined to the point it was at the beggining of the industrial revolution.
Instead of sophisticated drilling machines, we have degressed back to the point of having miners walk into the
caves and mines, pickaxes in hand. The must brave lava, cave-ins and even bizare creatures. You play as one of 
these poor souls; trying to scrape a living from the bowels of the earth. You must dig up ores, mine out new paths
and make new diescoveries. So, here you are, a miner in the year 2092, digging deep into the earth. You must tunnel,
mine, and dig. Discovering ores and dodging lava pools.

Ever moving downward!
