This directory contains the "controller" files for the Model-View-Controller
scheme of the Aeternus game.  

I am currently studying a few HTML5 Canvas "Game Engines" that are featured
in some of the best HTML5 Canvas books.

In particular:
"Core HTML5 Canvas" by David Geary
"HTML5 Canvas" by Fulton and Fulton
"HTML5 Animation with JavaScript" by Lamberta and Peters

This directory may contain some experimental files that will not be used
in the final product.
