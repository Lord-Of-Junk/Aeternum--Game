#THis file will be where the implementation of general Monster classes and such will be added
#Each type of monster will pull from a file to add it's stats, allowing us to make a lot of 
#monsters without needing to hard code a whole bunch of the suckers. This all still needs 
#planning and implementation so the code here will be more or less broken. This is one of those
