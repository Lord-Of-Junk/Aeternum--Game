This is the folder containg all of the python scripts responsible for creating our fancy text grids! Here
we have the module containing the functions for the creation (gridTools.py) and the script that utilises 
such functions (gridGen.py). Also we have the developmentMaps directory. Periodically, we can take maps 
we think are cool and put them here! That way, if we need a ton of maps quickly, we can fall back on these.

__NOTE__

This folder is, very rapidly, going to be come obsolete. I intend to replace most te functionality of this code with either Swift, Some C flavor, or better Python. These languages will be the core of the game (hopefully I will only need one) and I will decide in which lanuguage this code will be written.
